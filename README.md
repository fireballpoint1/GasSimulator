The aim of this repo is to build a tool and a semi-automated algorithm, to convert FORTRAN code to python<br>
magboltz.py is the lastest conversion <br>

<b>Features of change.py currently :</b> <br>
1.map arithematical operators from FORTRAN to corresponding in python <br>
2.map logical operators from FORTRAN to corresponsing operators in python <br>
3.retain comments as comments<br>
4.map dabs,dsqrt,dlog,dexp functions correctly<br>
5.replace FORTRAN do to Python for-loop<br>
6.replace irrelevant conditions like endif <br>
7.add : after function definition<br>
